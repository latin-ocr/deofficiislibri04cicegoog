condition of receiving a portion of the profit. In Frcuce,
this was, till lately, ond perhaps still is practised: fermers
of this description are called me‘toycrs, from their render·
ing half the produce. The younger Pliny even preferred
this mode: ‘⁴ Non nurumo sed partibus locem, ao deinde

it is called, should rather have been directed against those
Reman lawe which permitted it and conferred rights, im-
politic, unjnst, end barbarous on the creditor. If the com·
parison with c murderer were just, how criminul were they
who gave to the creditor this power, or permitted him to
retain itt Instead of inveighing agalnstthe crime, effectual
luws should heve been devised to prevent ita commission.
