Ἰ Otium. Odium, which eems the most probabis read-
issg, is found ln many MSS. though not preferred by the

cusin ers.

† Ipsgu. In many MSS. this pronoun does not appear; l
in one, ipo: this favors a previous happy conjecture of the
younger Gronovius, that this word-should be impio. Thus:

e republica, crepis impiis, cipue prohibiti, otium perse· 1

imur. L. iii. .
qul Apned te gloriari. The present, and every opportunity,
is taken by Cicero, of peying to his own conduct during
his consulate, most exuavegant complirnents, apparently
very little merited. Whename istrata tokeson himself l
to execute his fellowcitizens, unhenrd and without trial,
he needs some better justification then aelf-gratulation, or
the applauscs of those of his own party. Itis difficult to
essign any justificetion for putting to death the inferior
egerite in a conspiracy, at e moment when they were
pecrrlinrly trader the protection of the laws, end when
nothing could be fesred from them porsonally3 whilst a
formidable party at the same moment was suffered to
collect in arms, to enlist men, it would seem, without op
position ; and their leader, even encoureged to joiri them.
Afler the rebellion was quelled, no paine seem to have been
taken by the cenete, either to remove the causes of the
public discontents, or to reform their constitution, ill adept-
ed, or rather totally unfit, for the circumstances in which
multiplied conquesta hed placed them. Another rebellion,
still more formidable, speedily arose, in which their repub
lic, as might have been expected, was completely over-
whelmed. Had the party prevailed, of which Pompey was
the leader, tha avent would not have been different.
