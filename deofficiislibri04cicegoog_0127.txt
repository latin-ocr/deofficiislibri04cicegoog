term privatus does not ‘here' mean one cf the' citizens in
general, but a person distinguished by some circumstance

om them, on the one hand, on the other, from him, ‘⁸ qui
gerit personam civitatis.'' Adverting to the rules of go.
vernment in the popular states of antiquity, and in Rrinre
in particular, priuatae may be conjectured in this passage
to mean a person roho lias borne, but ie no longer in affirm
an es-mcgistrate. Among the interpretatione of the word
given byFacciolati,'1t ir said: “Privatus homo dicitur qui
iu magistratu non est3 ἰδιώτης. Nam qui magistratum
gerit est publicus.” But it is apprehended thatin this
passage something more is meant. The ellipse is mag-ic.
trote.- the circumstance of once having horne office is that
which induces Cicero to warn the ex-functionary against
harbouring ambitione designs, and against arrogance. This
interpretation is however submitted with much diffidenoe,
as it has not the support of any-passage where the word
bears exactly the same importum has it been suggested
by any previous commentator.
