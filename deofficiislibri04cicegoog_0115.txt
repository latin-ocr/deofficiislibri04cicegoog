l Simulavit. The warfare with Megara, occasioned by
the disputed sovereignty over the island of Salamis had
been productive to Athens of so much mischiec that it was
forbidden, under phin of death, to propose any firrthea
measures for the conquest of that island. A favourable
opportunity to effect it, however, offeriug, Solon pretended
madness‚ and coming into an assembly of the people, aster
much unconnected drsoourse, turned it seriously to the sub-
Ject of Megara, and oonvinced his auditors of the expe- l
dience of repeating their attempts to regain the island. ’
These were in consequence repeated, and were crowned
with success. Dio . Laert. lib. i. 46. Justin. lib. ii. 7.

MS. the reading, Solio, M. Crassum, which is adopted by
Ernesti. But an instance of adhercnce to the powerfirl
head ofa fection does not seem to hear relation to tluat
which Cicero had in view, namely‚-subservience to any
body, however despicable or vicious; submission to any
humiliation, in order to effect a political purpose. Iusionem¹
