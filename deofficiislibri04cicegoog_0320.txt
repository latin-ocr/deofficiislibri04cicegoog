Puffendorf, that merely abstaining from injury, carmot be
rechoned among benefits: that a lughwayman, for instance,
who does not murder you, cannotbe called your benefactor.
= Hobbe's doctrino is therefore thu's qualified by Puffendorf,
(ill. bb 1³.) provided that the promisee can legitimately
exact the performunce of that promise. Το this, Barbeyrae,
the learrmd and acute commentator on both Grotius and

that Paley appears to have changed his opinionon the sub-
