rata invidia, nec turpi jactura, quando erat adnisi

ἲ Miloni. Clodius having tehen into pay a number of
persons of indifferent character, for the purpose it was said,
ofwaylaying publicly, and murdering Cicero, Milo followed
the example of Clodius, and purchased all the gladiatore
whom he could procuro, in order to defend lus friend.
