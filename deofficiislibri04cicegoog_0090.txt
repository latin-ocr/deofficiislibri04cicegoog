LlB. 1. CAP. xxlt. 69

plus Africanus, singularis ct vir, et imperator, in
exscindenda Numantia, rei publicae profuit, quam
eodem tempore P. Nasica privatus* eum Ti.
Gracchum interemit. Quamquam haee quidem res
non solum ex domestica est ratione: (attingit enirn

bellicam, *quoniam vi manuque conlecta est) sed
tamen id ipsum est gestum consilio urbano, sino
exercitu. Illud autem optimum est,¹ in quod in·
vadi solere ab improbis et invidis audio:

Cedant arma togae, concedat laurea laudii

Ut euim alios omittam, nobis rem publicam
gubernantibus, nonne togae anna cessere? neque
enim periculum in republica fuit gravius‡ unquam,

'¹ Nasicaprivatus. consulatue. 615. Atthetime
Tib. Gracchus was put tn death by Scipio Nasica, (the act
from which Cicero was disposed to attribute so much
advantage to the state) N'asiea held no public office.

† Laurea laudi. Instead 01 laudi, many MSS, and all
early editions, read lingua. Tho author 01 tho invective
against Caesar, attributed to Sallust, Quintilian, lib xi. c. 1,
and Pina in the Life 01010010, adhere to the same readingr
but the present appears supported by the authority 01
Cicero himself. In his oration in Pison. 0. m. occurs
this passage: “Cum tu timidus ac tremens tuis ipse
furacissimis manibus detractam 0 cruentis fascibus lauream
ad portam Esquilinam abjecisti, indicasti uon modo atn-
plissimaa sed etiam minimae laudi lauream concessisse.”
Again, tib. xv. ep. 6. 3. “Quem ego currum, aut quam
lauream, cum tna laudatione conferrem l” In trutb, the
merit which he claimed on thia occasion was not coalined
to his tangue-other wcapo'ns were employed.

l Grunt'ns.¹ 'l'he secret fauotuers 01 these conspiratura,
am whom was rechoned Cicero's own colleague in the
cons te, C. Antonius, certainly increased the danger.
But was it really dispelled l-Did not many of the 'atton
in it, for instance Crassus, and Cesar, agata compare 1- ·
aaa what was the eraut?
