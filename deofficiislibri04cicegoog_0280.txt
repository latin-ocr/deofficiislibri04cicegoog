ὓ &ammanus tlte. 'l'he analogy is by no means per-
fect between the cases. Claudius withheld from the bu er
information respecting that very house,b which its u ' ity
and its vdua were ,rnaterially reduced. ln fact, the house
which he sold, was nat the identical house, as he well knew,
which in a short period would be starrding on that spot:
it must be replaced hya house less losty, and which would
eost ta the buyer uo small sum to unroof, reduce, and alter.
'l'his information related, therefore, ta the honae itaelf,
which he sold and warrauted. Not so with regard tc the
carn sold at Rhodes: the qrwlity of the corn was not thera
in question: the intelligence, which tha merchant withheld,
did aot relate to tlrat corn, but was completely extrinsic.
'I'hcugh he might be bound ta satisfy the buyer's inquiry,

byffirpfi atrue account of that corn, he was not bound
to “ ,unnslred an account of all other corn. Had he
autad his corn ta be merchantable, and afa given wei ht,
and the buyer had found the corn on delivery tc be ofless

weight, and full ot' weevils, then the comparison would
have been more just with a house, which, as the propriator
knew, must be reduced in height; and which he sold,
without revealing that circumstance.

lNcater. 'l'he grandfather of Cicero married a sister
of M. Gratidius, De Legg. iii. 16, whose son or grandson
was adopted by M. Marius, brother of C. Marius, the op-

nent of Syllaj and consequently, assumed the names of
