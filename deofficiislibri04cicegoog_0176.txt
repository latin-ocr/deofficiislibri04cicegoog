CAP. IX. Quibus rppps glorie etfides compe· ἵ
r ar.

Sne tle amicitia alio libro dietum est, qui inseri·
bitur Laelius-i Nune dieamus de gloria‚‡ quam-
quam ea qnoque de re duo sunt nostri libri; sed
attingamus, quando quidem eain rebus majoribus
administrandis adjuvat plurimum. Summa igitur

et perfecta gloria constat ex tribus bis: si diligit ¹
multitudo, si fidem habet, si eum admiratione
⁸ quadam honore dignos putat. Haee autern, si est
simplic-iter breviterque dicendum, quibus rebus

ὕ Gom. The ordinary reading is tam: though eum
appears but in one MS. and had been adopted but by ene
preeeding editor, Gernhard hae admitted it, apparently
with reason. Cicero's intention is not to reekon the pre·
bable acquisition of friends, amo the advantages of po
pularity‚ but to advert to that sole y.

CHAP'I'ER IX.

l Latias. In 'the second boola, De Divinatione, Cicero .
enumerate· his works: in that list, the dialogue‚ De Ami-
cilia, ond tbe present, do not appear: both were therefore
probably eomposed at a subsequent period3 but the dia·
logne, previous to the present work. ·

l Gloria. In the list mentioned in the preceding note,
no mention is made of this work-which was also, in all
probability, composed in the interrnediate time. In Ep.
ad Art xv. 27. and ed Fam. rvi. 2. it is alae nomem but
bas not been preserved.
